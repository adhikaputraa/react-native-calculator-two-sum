# Coding Challenge 1: Calculator

## Requirements
- Create a simple calculator that adds two numbers
- Implement UI inputs for two numbers
- Show the sum when the Add button is pressed

## Implementation
The Calculator component is implemented as a React Native component that:
1. Manages two input states for the numbers
2. Provides a function to add them together
3. Displays the result in a well-formatted UI

## Code Structure
- `Calculator.tsx`: Main component with all functionality
- Uses React hooks (useState) for state management
- Implements proper keyboard handling for numeric input

## Testing
You can test by:
1. Entering values in both input fields
2. Pressing the "Add Two Numbers" button
3. Verifying the correct sum appears in the "Total" field
